# Stats-class-projects
Projects done during my Data Science courses at UC Davis

Stats 141A was a course dealing with the fundamentals of data science in which I was introduced to data analysis and data visualization. 

Stats 141B was a course dealing with data and web technologies. This course taught me how to scrape web pages and use web services/APIs. Also the class included topics such as SQL and interactive data visualization. This class is still in progress so projects for this class will be uploaded by April 2019
