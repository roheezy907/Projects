This Project was divided into three seperate parts

# Part 1: Discover patterns through analyzing features of apartment advertisements 

I examined a data set based on recent Craigslist posts for
apartment rentals in California. Craigslist has few rules about how posts should be
formatted, so this data set is messy, therefore, not every thing will be 100% accurate.

# Part 2: Exploring spatial characteristcs

Within this part I studied the spatial characteristics of the rental market.
Furtheremore, I combined the craigslit data set with demographic data from the US Census Bureau to make further
inferences.

# Part 3: Scraping to get the data

I cleaned and extracted features from a messy, expanded version of
the Craigslist data set. In the messy data set, each Craigslist post is in a separate text
file. The goal was to recreate a data set simmilar to the data set used in part one and part two
