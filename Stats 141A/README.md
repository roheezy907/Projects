There were two main projects in this class:

# Craigslist Apartment Postings in California

Craigslist is a website that allows people to post classified advertisements for free. These posts span a variety of subjects, including job postings, housing rentals, and item sales.
Craigslist started in the San Francisco Bay Area and now serves 570 cities worldwide. Posts are grouped by city to make relevant ads easy to find. This project was divided into three parts which are explained in depth within the Craigslist folder. 


# USPS Automated Mail Sorting System 

The U.S. Postal Service processes an average of 21.1 million pieces of mail per hour. Outbound mail must be sorted according to the zip code of its destination. 
In the past, postal workers sorted mail by hand, which was tedious and expensive. Over the last 40years, USPS has switched to automated mail sorting. 
The sorting machines use statistical classifiers to identify the individual digits in the zip code on each piece of mail. 
Zip codes only contain the numbers 0 through 9. The task of this project was to implement a k-nearest neighbors classifier tp 
fit a model to classify handwritten digits and use cross-validation to examine the 
effectiveness of the model.
