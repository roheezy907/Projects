# UC Davis STA 141B Project Descriptions

### Project 1: In this project the goal was to extract data from USDA Food Compositions's API inorder. The goal was to utilize this API in order to extract price information of fruits and crops. Then merge information on food prices 
with infromation on the prices of various fruits/crops which was provided. After extracting and merging, I then began analyzing the data in order to find quality insights within the data. 

### Project 2: In this project, I web-scraped the text of many articles off the San Francisco Chronicle's website for different categories. After web-scraping the data
the goal was to implement NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques in order to analyze and get insight into what are the most common topics talked about for each category within San Francisco Chronicle.

### Project 3: In this project I, used SQL queries and pandas to explore data in Lahman's Baseball Database, which contains "complete batting and pitching statistics from 
1871 to 2018, plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records, post-season data, and more."
